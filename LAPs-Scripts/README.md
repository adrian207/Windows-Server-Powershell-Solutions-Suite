**Author:** Adrian Johnson (adrian207@gmail.com)  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** October 2025

Comprehensive PowerShell automation solution for Microsoft's Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPs) deployment, configuration, and management on Windows Server environments.

## Executive Overview

### Recommendation
Deploy LAPs to centrally manage and secure local administrator passwords across your Windows environment, reducing credential theft risk and ensuring compliance with security best practices.

### Why LAPs?
- **Enhanced Security**: Eliminates shared local administrator passwords across multiple systems
- **Automated Password Management**: Regularly rotates passwords without manual intervention
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete audit trail of password access and changes
- **Centralized Control**: Store passwords securely in Active Directory

### How It Works
- LAPs components installed on managed computers via Group Policy
- Local administrator passwords stored as encrypted data in Active Directory
- Authorized administrators can retrieve passwords when needed
- Automatic password rotation on configurable schedule

### Implementation Approach
1. Configure LAPs Group Policy settings
2. Deploy LAPs client to managed computers
3. Configure password rotation and backup keys
4. Monitor compliance and health

## Key Features

- **Centralized Management**: Unified LAPs configuration and deployment
- **Password Retrieval**: Secure access to local administrator passwords
- **Group Policy Integration**: Automated configuration via GPO
- **Audit & Compliance**: Comprehensive tracking and reporting
- **Backup Key Management**: Configure and rotate backup encryption keys
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time status and statistics
- **Troubleshooting Tools**: Diagnose and resolve issues quickly
